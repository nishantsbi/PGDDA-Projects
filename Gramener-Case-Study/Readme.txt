Business Objectives
Project Brief
We are working for a consumer finance company. When the company receives a loan
application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s
profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision -
 If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan to the person
results in a loss of business to the company.
 If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan i.e. default, then approving the loan to the
person results in a financial loss to the company.
In this case study, we consider only consumers whose loan application is approved. Here, our
aim is to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influencing the tendency of
defaulting.
