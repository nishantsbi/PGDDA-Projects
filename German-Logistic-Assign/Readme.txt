Problem Statement

In EDA case study, you studied the behavior of consumers who had defaulted and who had not with respect to certain variables.

 

Now suppose you are working in the risk management team at a german bank and you have to assist the credit manager to decide whether to approve the loan for a prospective customer or not. So you have to make a logistic regression model to predict the chances of the customer defaulting on the loan or not. The amount the customer will default is not to be predicted. You have to just predict whether the customer will default or not.
