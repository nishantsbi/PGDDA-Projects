Introducing the Problem
Problem Statement

You had explored the Mashable news article popularity dataset in EDA module. You had observed two critical insights-

    Articles published on Social Media saw, on an average, a larger number of shares than other channels
    The average number of shares of articles published over the weekend was more than the articles published over weekdays.

Let's say you are consulting the CEO of Mashable to help him build a strategy to maximize shares of news articles. Based on the validity of the two hypotheses above, he will consider the following changes:

    Whether he should set up a team to work on weekends
    If option (1) above is recommended, should the new 'weekend team' publish majority of social media news articles
     For employees who work on weekdays only: Should they publish more social media articles than those of other channels
    For all social media articles they publish: Should they publish more on weekends than the weekdays  

The recommendations will be implemented only if there is a significant statistical difference between the options.
